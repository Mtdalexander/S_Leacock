## Small Gems Podcast: Show Notes

Title:

Small Gems Podcast: Episode 1
The Stephen Leacock Museum

Author:

Matthew Alexander

Description:

We all need a good laugh, and Canadians have proven themselves, time and time again, to possess a robust sense of humour. But, have you ever wondered where that humour could have come from? Have you ever asked yourself, who was one of the first great pioneers of Canadian humour? For many, the answer is Stephen Leacock, one of the most prolific authors of Canadian humour in the first half of the twentieth-century, and today the Leacock Museum, on the coast of Old Brewery Bay, stands as a monument to his historical and literary legacy. 

In this podcast we give a brief history of Stephen Leacock and the Stephen Leacock Museum. We will learn about how The Old Brewery Bay came to become a museum, its place as a national Canadian historic treasure, and how it serves as a piece of the local heritage of Orillia. 

Guest:

Jenny Martynyshyn, Museum Coordinator.
